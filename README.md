# Simple blog page

The project required building a home page with fetched posts to which we can then enter and add them to favorites, there are also comments in the post.

The whole project was built with react.

State management - instead of redux I used context.

The data is fetching from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

The css module was used for styling and I tried to use BEM.<br>
The overall UI is not that impressive as my main focus was functionality

`yarn start`
